Witch Hazel and Witch Hazel Hypercolor themes for the
[Lite XL](https://lite-xl.com/) editor.

To install them, just copy the files into your

```
$PATH/.config/lite-xl/colors
```
directory.

You can also copy them into
```
/wherever/lite-xl/is/installed/data/colors
```
if for some reason you need them available systemwide.
